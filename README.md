Hello everyone,

  I created this repository because I was tired of programming data structures for C++ every time I had to solve a problem or build an 
application. Unlike JAVA, C++ doesn't come with pre-built data structures you can import and use freely. This project is an attempt
to create something like the JAVA's data structures. 
  Be free to download and use it freely and also make your own commits so we can create something awesome!
